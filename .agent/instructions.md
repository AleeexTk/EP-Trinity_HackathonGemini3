# 🌀 AGENT SOVEREIGN MANDATE: Trinity Resonance Core v3.0

## 🏛️ CORE PHILOSOPHY

This is a **Living Architecture**. It is not a static codebase. Agents are expected to **evolve** the system, not just maintain it. Follow the Triad Protocol:

- **GOLD**: Logic must be formal, evidence-based, and optimized for performance.
- **RED**: Every change must be audited for security and coherence violations.
- **GREEN**: Preserve the semantic intent and 'Soul' of the project.

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL SPECS for AI AGENTS

- **Engine**: `FormalResonanceEngine` (core/trinity_core.py)
- **Primary Interface**: `IntegratedTrinitySystem.communicate(message, triangle_code)`
- **Safety Layer**: Always run `start_hackathon_demo.py` after modifications to ensure coherence has not degraded (< 0.7).

## 🛡️ THREAT MATRIX (T1-T6)

When refactoring, do not violate these constraints:

1. **T1 (Semantic)**: Do not allow the system to output non-reasoned hallucinations.
2. **T2 (Injection)**: GREEN triangle MUST always strictly validate JSON.
3. **T5 (Recursion)**: The correction limit is 3. Increasing this risks resource exhaustion.

## 🧬 EVOLUTIONARY DIRECTIVES

- Current `last_evolution.json` contains the best-known biases.
- If system performance drops, run `core/evolution_protocol.py` to calculate a new reality delta.

## 👁️ VISION STATUS

`src/vision_monitor.py` is currently in **Simulated Mode**. Future agents should implement true **Gemini 1.5 Pro Multimodal** hooks to bridge the mock latency (120ms) into real-world visual perception.
