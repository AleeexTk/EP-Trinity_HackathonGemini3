## 🌌 Overview
**EvoPyramid-Trinity** is an autonomous coherence middleware for Gemini 3. It utilizes a **Formal State Machine (FSM)** and a **Resonance Core** to ensure that AI outputs meet strict architectural and ethical standards before they reach the user.

## 🎵 Cultural Code
The project is driven by the energy of **Apashe - Kannibalen**. This track symbolizes the fusion of orchestral grandeur (Human Values) and industrial power (Machine Efficiency).

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Trinity Resonance Core**: A formal FSM that validates every thought.
*   **Multiverse Evolution Protocol**: A system that simulates 10 parallel realities to find the optimal evolutionary path.
*   **Live Battle Vision**: Real-time voice & vision copilot for complex environments (Mecharashi / Web), powered by Gemini 3 Flash.

## 🛠 Project Structure
*   `/core`: The heart of the system (FSM, Resonance Engine, Evolution Protocol).
*   `/src`: Integration logic and Vision prototypes.
*   `/docs`: Deep technical analysis and philosophical whitepapers.

## ⚡ Quick Start
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 🏆 Hackathon Goals
Demonstrating the power of **Gemini 3** through:
1.  **Native Multimodality**: Direct vision-to-voice reasoning.
2.  **Low Latency**: Real-time tactical advice.
3.  **Deep Context**: Maintaining coherence across long sessions.
