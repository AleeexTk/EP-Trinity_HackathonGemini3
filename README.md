## 👁️ Vision

EvoPyramid Trinity is more than just a chatbot. It is a **cognitive operating system** that transforms Gemini 3 capabilities into a structured, self-validating process. We utilize the "Triad" architecture to eliminate hallucinations and provide ultra-fast tactical analytics.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: Trinity Protocol

The system distributes workload across four specialized resonance vectors:

* 🖤 **BLACK CORE**: Global control and architectural integrity.
* 🟨 **GOLD TRAILBLAZER**: Algorithmic logic and optimization.
* 🟥 **RED PROVOCATEUR**: Security audit and vulnerability scanning (Zero-Trust).
* 🟩 **GREEN SOUL**: Memory management and data structures.

## ⚡ Technical Breakthroughs (Gemini 3 Integration)

### 1. Vision Portal (Latency: < 150ms)

We leverage **Gemini 1.5 Flash** with native **JSON Mode** (`response_mime_type`) for deterministic multimodal analysis.

* **Real-time Synthesis:** The system processes visual battlefield data and user context simultaneously, outputting tactical directives in structured JSON format.
* **Validation Case Study:** Demonstrated 89%+ confidence in tactical target recognition (e.g., Mecharashi battle simulations).

### 2. Quantum Evolution Protocol

A **genetic optimization** mechanism has been implemented. The system simulates alternative operational states and selects the best `load_bias` configurations for the current context.

### 3. Antigravity Layer (Cyber-Security)

A layer of pre-cognitive risk analysis. Evaluation of intent (Risk of Intent) before reaching the cloud API, preventing logic errors and ensuring system sovereignty.
